# TheSimpleDoctor
Dream Team for HackIllinois2018

The project is based on the Making Sense Out of Complicated Clinical Information Challenge

One of the contributors is a biomedical engineering student so the medical terminology seemed interesting and the whole idea of a chat bot seemed like a cool idea to learn how to implement and we thouroughly think it could make a difference in the medical field.
